Stabat Mater dolorosa           The grieving Mother
Iuxta crucem lacrimosa          stood weeping beside the cross
Dum pendebat Filius.            where her Son was hanging.

Cuius animam gementem           Through her weeping soul,
Contristatam et dolentem        compassionate and grieving,
Pertransivit gladius.           a sword passed.

O quam tristis et afflicta      O how sad and afflicted
Fuit illa benedicta             was that blessed Mother
Mater unigeniti!                of the only-begotten,

Que moerebat et dolebat,        who mourned and grieved,
Pia Mater, dum videbat          seeing and bearing the torment
Nati poenas incliti.            of her glorious child.

Quis est homo qui non fleret,   Who is it that would not weep,
Matrem Christi si videret       seeing Christâ€™s Mother
In tanto supplicio?             in such agony?

Quis non posset contristari,    Who could not feel compassion
Christi Matrem contemplari      on beholding the Holy Mother
Dolentem cum Filio?             suffering with her Son?

Pro peccatis suae gentis        For the sake of his peoples' sins,
Vidit Iesum in tormentis,       she saw Jesus tormented,
Et flagellis subditum.          and subjected to whips.

Vidit suum dulcem natum         She saw her sweet child
Moriendo desolatum              die desolate,
Dum emisit spiritum.            as he gave up his spirit.

Pia Mater, fons amoris          Devout Mother, fountain of love,
Me sentire vim doloris          make me feel the power of sorrow,
Fac, ut tecum lugeam.           that I may grieve with you.

Sancta Mater, istud agas,       Holy Mother, make
Crucifixi fige plagas           the wounds of the Crucifixion
Cordi meo valide.               in my own heart.

Fac, ut ardeat cor meum         Grant that my heart may burn
In amando Christum Deum         in the love of Christ my God,
Ut sibi complaceam.             that I may greatly please him.

Tui nati vulnerati,             Let me share the pain
Tam dignati pro me pati,        of your own wounded Son
Poenas mecum divide.            who chose to suffer so much for me.

Fac me vere tecum flere,        Let me truly weep with you,
Crucifixo condolere,            and show compassion for the crucified
Donec ego vixero.               as long as I live.

Juxta crucem tecum stare,       I wish to stand with you next to the Cross
Te libenter sociare             and willingly to be your companion
In planctu desidero.            in lamentation.

Virgo virginum praeclara,       Most illustrious virgin of virgins,
Mihi jam non sis amara          Do not be harsh with me,
Fac me tecum plangere.          allow me to weep with you.

Fac, ut portem Christi mortem   Grant that I might bear
Passionis fac consortem,        the suffering and death of Christ,
Et plagas recolere.             and receive his wounds.

Fac me plagis vulnerari,        Wound me with his wounds,
Cruce hac inebriari,            make me drunk with the Cross
Ob amorem Filii.                for the love of your Son.

Inflammatus et accensus         Burning and on fire,
Per te, Virgo, sim defensus     let me be defended by you, O Virgin,
In die iudicii.                 on the Day of Judgment.

Fac me cruce custodiri          May I be guarded by the cross,
Morte Christi praemuniri        protected by Christ's death,
Confoveri gratia.               nurtured by grace.

Quando corpus morietur,         When my body dies,
Fac, ut animae donetur          let my soul be given
Paradisi gloria.                the glory of paradise.
Amen.                           Amen.
